My name is Knut Holm and I was born in Opava in early 1990. After studying in Brno and living in Prague for a few years, I moved to Sweden with my wife Terka and our two cats in early 2018 and adopted a Swedish name. We lived in Stockholm for about five years, then bought a house in the small town of Degerfors in central Sweden, where we still live today.
