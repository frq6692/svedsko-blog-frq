# 12Th Class Result 2024

Boards ensure unbiased examinations at the secondary and higher secondary levels. All boards of higher secondary levels I-II of the board of intermediate and secondary education are also responsible for the results. These boards manage and plan Matriculation and intermediate part 1 and 2 examinations and provide the annual and supplementary FSC part 2 to their enrolled students on time. 

A boardâ€™s fundamental responsibility is to conduct the annual and supplementary exams for secondary and higher secondary education, announce the results of the intermediate part 2 exams, and award certificates to students who have passed the final exams. As soon as the boards announce your FSC part 2 2024 result, you can check it on theinfo. Pk. You can check it by name or roll number.

Enrollment is the foundation of Pakistani education. Students who have passed the matriculation exams from the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education must take the intermediate examinations (part 1 and part 2). In addition, several regional boards administer Inter Part me and II board exams in Pakistan. 

Board exams are becoming more popular, so these boards were created. These boards organize, regulate, develop, control, conduct, and manage the HSSC education examination. The results of FSC, ICS, ICOM, and FA part 2 are usually announced in June and July.
